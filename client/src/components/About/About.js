                        The project is inspired by the sacred geometry, that consists of geometric patterns that work as building blocks that can be used for manifesting, magic, healing, and evolution.
                        It was started by Diana Todorova in 2019 year when she is in Vigo, Spain. She is working in architectural studio that shares office space with 3D lab.
                        Diana get easily inspired by their work and decide to create a collaboration. That's how uniQUEode is born.
